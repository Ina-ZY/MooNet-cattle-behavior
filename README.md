# MooNet-cattle-behavior
MooNet is a decoupled spatio-temporal network that fuses RGB-D data to accurately recognize four key cattle behaviors with 96.7% accuracy.


This research paper presents a novel method for cattle behavior recognition using a decoupled spatiotemporal network with RGB-D (color and depth) data fusion, achieving **96.7% accuracy** in identifying four key behaviors (**sniffing, walking, looking back, and running**) by effectively extracting both spatial and temporal features while leveraging the complementary information from both color and depth modalities.
