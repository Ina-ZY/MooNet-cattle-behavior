# DCFA-Net: Decoupled Cross-modal Fusion Attention Network for Cattle Behavior Recognition

DCFA-Net is a novel spatio-temporal deep learning architecture designed for **RGB-D based cattle behavior recognition**, achieving **96.7% accuracy** on four fundamental behaviors: **sniffing**, **walking**, **looking back**, and **running**.

This method introduces a decoupled architecture with **cross-modal fusion** and **cross-scale temporal attention** mechanisms to handle challenges in complex farm environments, such as subtle motion differences and noisy visual data.
